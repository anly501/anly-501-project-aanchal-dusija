    <p>Using Data Science in the fashion industry. 

      E-commerce systems for many large fashion firms produce a ton of data that data scientists can use. To comprehend the needs of the customer and analyze their behavior, we apply data science. This is essential for the fashion sector since firms may boost sales with better services that anticipate customer wants and assist clients in finding what they are looking for. <br> <br>

      Data science is also used to anticipate a product's lifespan on a website and inform clients of how likely it is that the items will run out soon. This aids the company in forecasting, which is essential for any business and involves determining how many outfits to make and send to a specific market. Big fashion companies will have information on their sales both online and in physical locations, and this information may be utilized to forecast product demand, calculate stock requirements, and set prices.  <br> <br>
