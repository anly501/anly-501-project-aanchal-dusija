        <p  style="font-size:12px;"> Hey everyone! My name is Aanchal Dusija (she/her/hers). I am ecstatic to be a part of the DSAN program at Georgetown University! <br> <br>

            Dexterously completing my assignments during my internship, fetched me a full-time position as a Research Associate in the National Stock Exchange for the Economic Policy & Research Department. I worked on the NSE Dataroom, a curated data zone to facilitate research in the area of financial econometrics, market microstructure, and liquidity analysis among others in a cloud computing environment. This research facility allows harnessing historical tick-by-tick orders and trade data available at NSE. Aside from that, my daily responsibilities included writing articles about current economic developments for the NSE's macroeconomic magazine called the Market Pulse. <br> <br>
            
            My academic journey started with my urge to take on new challenges, combined with my interest in numbers and computers, which led me to major in BSc Applied Statistics and Analytics during my undergraduate studies. Wanting to gain a new perspective and an interdisciplinary background, I pursued a Postgraduate Diploma in Economics with a specialization in Finance. During the course, I went down the rabbit hole of researching and volunteering as a Research Assistant for a project on Microfinance for Women Empowerment by performing analytics in R and Stata to create positive disruptions in society. Wanting to study a semester abroad, I enrolled in a summer school program at the London School of Economics in Statistical Methods of Risk Management. <br> <br>
            
            Implementing projects based on what I learned in my classes kept me on my toes and motivated me to research and learn more than what was taught in class. This liberty fueled my creativity and innovation, allowing me to pursue projects in a variety of fields. Some of my projects have been Detection of Covid-19 Using Chest X-ray Images, Predictive Modelling of Flight Delays, Credit Spreads in the NBFC Sector, Six Sigma in Dentistry, Queuing Theory on Port Handling Systems, Application of Markov Chains in General Elections. <br> <br>
            
            While such a diverse range of curricular and professional commitments kept me occupied, I still found time to participate in socio-cultural activities. I volunteered to assist at Paws Hunger, where I supplied food to stray dogs and cats. I also assisted Mega Beach Warriors with beach clean-ups every weekend. At The Mumbai Art Collective, a gallery of creative ideation for art thinkers, I worked as the head photographer and handled social media platforms. I was a member of my undergraduate college's administration and logistics team. I also contributed in NMIMS's Entrepreneurship Cell. </p>
